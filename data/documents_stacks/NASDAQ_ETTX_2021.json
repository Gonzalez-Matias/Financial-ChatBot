We have retained\ncommercial rights in all major markets in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.\nAntibiotics Background\nThe introduction of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections is recognized as one of the most\ntransformative events in medicine. Antibiotics either kill bacteria (cytocidal) or inhibit bacterial cell growth (cytostatic), in\nboth cases allowing the body\u2019s natural immune system to clear the bacteria. After penicillin, a \u03b2-lactam class antibiotic,\nentered the market in the early 1940s, antibiotics became one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in history. The\nmodern era of antibiotics began in the 1950s with the discovery and commercialization of a number of antibiotic classes\nand molecules including additional \u03b2-lactams, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and polymyxins.\nThere are two main varieties of bacteria, Gram-positive and Gram-negative, which are identified using a common\nlaboratory staining test known as the \u201cGram stain.\u201d Gram-positive bacteria are surrounded by a single membrane, while\nGram-negative bacteria have both an inner membrane and an outer membrane. Due to this increased complexity, it has\nhistorically been more challenging to develop products that target Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas,\nAcinetobacter and Enterobacteriaceae, a family of related organisms th",

Of\nsignificant concern, one study reported greater than 98% of Acinetobacter isolates in an ICU from non-clinical sources\nsuch as bedrails and door handles, were determined to be multidrug resistant.\fTable of Contents\nPneumonia and bloodstream infections caused by drug-resistant Acinetobacter can have mortality rates\napproaching 50%. Antibiotic-resistance rates of Acinetobacter to current standard-of-care treatments are some of the\nhighest reported, between 30% and 50% in the United States and greater than 90% in parts of Europe and Asia.\nAcinetobacter resistance to \u03b2-lactams is primarily driven by the expression of Class D \u03b2-lactamases, often in combination\nwith Class A and/or Class C \u03b2-lactamases. There are currently no effective antibiotics indicated for the treatment of\nmultidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections. Durlobactam is the first clinical-stage BLI with sufficient broad-spectrum\nactivity against class A, C, and D \u03b2-lactamases to potentially restore the efficacy of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics against multidrug-\nresistant Acinetobacter.\nSulbactam, the \u03b2-lactam antibiotic used in SUL-DUR has superior microbiological potency against Acinetobacter\ncompared to other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics based on in vitro and in vivo analyses.

In contrast, SUL-DUR showed potent activity against this subset,\nwith an MIC90 of 2 mg/L and 97.9% of isolates susceptible to \u2264 4 mg/L of SUL-DUR.\nCompetition\nWe are initially developing SUL-DUR for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections. Due to\nrising resistance rates, standard-of-care treatment for multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections often includes a\ncombination of several last-line treatment options, including carbapenems, tetracyclines, polymyxins, and other generically\navailable agents. Despite using best available therapy, mortality rates of patients with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter\ninfections is reported as high as 50%.

These factors contribute to\ndecreased resolution of such infections and therefore frequently require hospital-based therapy. ETX0282CPDP is designed\nto treat cUTIs, including those caused by multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including some carbapenem-resistant\nstrains, or CRE. Enterobacteriaceae species cause approximately 85% of all UTIs, of which E. coli is the most common\npathogen, causing approximately 75% of infections. In addition, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas are also relatively common\nUTI pathogens. The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has reduced the efficacy of commonly used oral antibiotics\nsuch as levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, both fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In the United States,\nover 30% of UTIs caused by E. coli and 10% of UTIs caused by Klebsiella are resistant to fluoroquinolones.\nMarket Opportunity\nPatients with UTIs caused by bacteria resistant to existing oral treatment options frequently require hospital\nadmission for treatment with IV antibiotics, even when they are otherwise healthy and fit to be treated outside the hospital\nsetting. In the United States, it is currently estimated that between 3 and 4 million UTIs are treated in the hospital per year.\nHospital admission not only leads to inconvenience for the patient and high treatment cost for the healthcare system, but it\nalso increases the risk of transmitting drug-resistant bacterial strains to other hospitalized patients and potentially exposing\nUTI patients to other, more serious hospital-acquired infections.

Among \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, penicillin\nderivatives and cephalosporins are the most commonly used. Carbapenems, another class of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, are\ngenerally more effective against Gram-negative multidrug resistant pathogens; but to preserve their activity, they are often\nlimited for use as a last resort.\nAntibiotic Resistance\nAntibiotic resistance is a direct consequence of antibiotic use. No sooner was penicillin adopted in clinical use,\nthat the first cases of penicillin-resistant infections were reported. Indeed, resistance to penicillin, as was subsequently\nfound to be the case for other natural product-derived antibiotics, pre-dates its medicinal use. This issue has escalated in the\nmodern era, as millions of metric tons of antibiotics have been produced for human therapeutic use and use in agriculture\nand animal husbandry.

For a period, the discovery of new antibiotics kept pace with the emergence of resistance; however, this is\nno longer the case and as a result, clinicians now commonly resort to using a combination of suboptimal antibiotics in an\nattempt to treat antibiotic resistant infections. For example, in the United States and European Union from 2004 to 2015,\nthe use of last-resort antibiotics, carbapenems and polymyxins, increased annually by 6% and 8%, respectively. The\nnegative consequences of this approach are twofold, as inappropriate antibiotic therapy leads to poorer outcomes for\npatients and potential subinhibitory and subtherapeutic antibiotic concentrations can further promote the development of\nantibiotic resistance.\nAntibiotic resistance is now a global health threat and when bacteria develop resistance to drugs in at least three or\nmore antibiotic classes, they are commonly referred to as multidrug-resistant. Bacteria use a number of mechanisms to\ndevelop resistance to antibiotics. Resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics primarily occurs when bacteria acquire foreign genes\nthat encode \u03b2-lactamases, enzymes that inactivate the \u03b2-lactam antibiotic by breaking apart the \u03b2-lactam ring, which\nrenders the antibiotic inactive. Below, a \u03b2-lactamase enzyme (blue box) is shown binding to and cleaving the blue \u03b2-lactam\nring of a carbapenem antibiotic. \u03b2-lactamases are widely prevalent and are classified into four classes, Classes A, B, C and\nD. Since 1976, researchers have discovered and developed \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) that essentially restore the\nefficacy of the \u03b2-lactam antibiotic by neutralizing \u03b2-lactamase enzymes.

Gonorrhea can be associated with serious complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic\npregnancy and infertility, as well as an increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. Despite the continued use\nof effective antibiotics, it remains one of the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infections in the world with an\nestimated 87 million people worldwide infected each year. The occasional absence of symptoms, more frequent in women,\nis thought to be one reason for sustained levels of infection.

Taken together, antibiotics remain the\nmainstay for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea caused by N. gonorrhoeae.\fTable of Contents\nN. gonorrhoeae is the bacterial pathogen responsible for gonorrhea and has a strong propensity for uptake of\nchromosomal DNA from other genera of Neisseria which allows the bacteria to accumulate many mutations in\nchromosomal genes leading to frequent resistance of antibiotics. For example, penicillin was introduced for N.\ngonorrhoeae infections in 1943, and initial resistance was reported in 1945. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics were first used to\ntreat gonorrhea in 1949 and have been one of the most successful classes of antibiotics against N. gonorrhoeae, but even so\nresistance was identified in 1969. One member of this class, ciprofloxacin, was introduced in 1980 and resistance was\nidentified in 1990. More recently cephalosporin antibiotics, notably cefixime, had been widely used for the treatment of\ngonorrhea due to their oral administration along with a favorable efficacy and safety profile, although resistance by N.\ngonorrhoeae has been reported since 2007. As widespread use of these antibiotics drove the emergence of drug-resistant N.\ngonorrhoeae strains, treatment guidelines have subsequently been amended. Ceftriaxone is currently the only CDC-\nrecommended option for the treatment of gonorrhea and, until recently, was administered with azithromycin, a broad-\nspectrum antibiotic, to ",
